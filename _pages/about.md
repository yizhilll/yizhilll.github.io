I am currently a Computer Science PhD student funded by the University of Manchester, supervised by [Prof. Chenghua Lin](https://chenghualin.wordpress.com/). I am also a co-founder of the [Multimodal Art Projection (M-A-P)](https://m-a-p.ai) research community, which aims to drive open-source academia-level research to cutting-edge level as the industry. I've collaborated with [Dr. Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/) and had a lot fun.

### Research

My current research focus is mainly about the the post-training of LLM with reinforce learning. Specifically, as we have stepped into the new era of training LLM with one/similar recipe by setting customized goals, how to train a real generalized model under such a paradigm?


Other research questions involving post-training of LLMs and multi-modal alignment:

* How to build an effective and robust self-evolved framework for LLMs with data synthesis (maingly during post-trianing)?
* How to unifiy the understanding and generation of vision-langauge models?
* The paradgim of aligning model among the text, vision and audio modalities.

Before the LLM era, my research interests could be concluded as these topics: language model evaluation, information retrieval, fairness in NLP, music modelling, and general topics natural language modelling.
More recent and detailed topics can be referred to my [publication pages](https://yizhilll.github.io/publications/).
